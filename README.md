## Background
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we will need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Therefore, we have been tasked to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate such models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and later undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we will use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we will compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### What We are Creating

   1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
   2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
   3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
   4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis 


## Oerview

In this analysis, we used a dataset with 96 different variables from loan applicants composed of 115675 costumers from which 68470 were low risk and 347 high risk applicants based on the type of data collected. 


1: Using Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

We used different resampling methods to predict the credit risk. Prilimianry the accuracy score for the model was calculated about 66%, Figure 1.

### Figure 1: Accuracy score of the model

---------------------------


The confusion matrix was also generated for the priliminry sampling method as shown in Figure 2.
